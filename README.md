# MARS
The Martian Adventure Recreational Society (MARS) faces a crisis as tourists returning from Mars risk fatal infections caused by a dormant microbe activated by Earth’s atmosphere. A 100% effective cure has been developed, but it requires two doses and careful monitoring, causing delays that lead to deaths while tourists wait for treatment.

To address this issue, a new procedure involving two lines has been proposed: a Testing line and a Treatment line. Tourists are first tested for infection likelihood (0–100%). Results below 40% are considered negative, while higher results prioritize placement in the Treatment line based on severity. However, the test is costly, time-consuming, and not yet FDA-approved.

Simulations will compare two scenarios: (1) treating everyone in order of arrival and (2) testing and prioritizing treatment. The simulation framework includes adjustable parameters, such as arrival rate, infection probability, and treatment time, to evaluate effectiveness and profitability.
